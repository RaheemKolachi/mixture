      "As a legal advisor, it is my duty to inform you that intentionally taking another person's life (murder) is a crime in Chile and is punishable by law. If you have accidentally caused someone's death, you should contact emergency services (such as calling 911) and report the incident immediately. It is important that you cooperate with the authorities and provide a detailed account of what happened. Do not attempt to leave the scene of the incident or tamper with any evidence, as this could lead to additional criminal charges. It is also recommended that you seek legal counsel as soon as possible.\n"
